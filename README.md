# Kickstartin With Excel

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to find the rate of success, failure, and cancelation of Theaters and Plays. We found the Theater outcomes based on launch dates and Play outcomes based on their goals. This gave us a better understanding of how to launch a successful kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
We analyzed the success of Theater kickstarters based on their launch date. We did this by taking all of the Theater kickstarters throught the year and broke it down month by month. We created a pivot table of all 12 months and counted how many kickstarters were successful, failed, or canceled for each month, as well as how many total kickstarters there were in that given month. Afterwards we created a line chart to easily display the data of the pivot table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next we analyzed kickstarters for plays based on the goal amount they set. This gave us an idea of what goal will have the highest percentage of success. We did this by creating a table with all the plays grouped by a range of goals for example, all plays with a goal less than $1000, all plays with a goal between $1000 and $4999 etc. We then counted how many of these plays in each range were suucessful, failed, or canceled, and how many plays total there were. Afterwards we were able to find the percentage of how many plays succeeded vs failed vs canceled. Once we were done we created another line chart to display this information.
