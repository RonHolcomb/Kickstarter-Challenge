# Kickstartin With Excel

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to find the rate of success, failure, and cancelation of Theaters and Plays. We found the Theater outcomes based on launch dates and Play outcomes based on their goals. This gave us a better understanding of how to launch a successful kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
We analyzed the success of Theater kickstarters based on their launch date. We did this by taking all of the Theater kickstarters throught the year and broke it down month by month. We created a pivot table of all 12 months and counted how many kickstarters were successful, failed, or canceled for each month, as well as how many total kickstarters there were in that given month. Afterwards we created a line chart to easily display the data of the pivot table which is shown below.
